# An Ode To Adventure

In Pokemon Gold and Silver:
"Hey! Do you know what you just did? You've taken your first step into Kanto."  
This was when a whole new world opened to me.

In Pokemon Ruby and Sapphire:
The rising action of Route 119, fortree city, and the falling tension of route 120. Its like I am in a monomyth and am going through my own hero's journey.
