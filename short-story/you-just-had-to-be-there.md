Some social phenomena were best enjoyed as they were happening.

Consider Homestuck in 2011. It was a cultural phenomenon, with its fandom doing insane things on a daily basis.  
Readers would obsess over the comic, with update notifiers on their websites activating every 6 hours. <https://mspanotify.tumblr.com/>
