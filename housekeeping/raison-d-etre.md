I imagine that future people would like to know the thoughts of an everyman in the 2020s.

The most robust form of digital media is Git, so this digital garden should succumb to digital rot slower than others.  
Additionally, the Git history could show more information about me and my thoughts over time, because anyone can access snapshots of the garden at different times.

Because git history will be kept for all time, I want to make sure that it remains a reasonable size even 70 years later.  
Because of this, I will never include any photos, audio, or videos. Just text.  
If I include photos, the git history can balloon to gigabytes even if the photo is deleted later.

I plan to maintain this digital garden for my entire life.  
I plan to publish paperback books of my whole digital garden once every 20 years, warts and all.  
It will be expensive to self-publish, probably like 7000 CAD.  
Publishing paper is important because it has a chance of lasting even longer than digital files.
